### How to Colaborate

- Change to Master Branch

```shell
git checkout master
```

- Fetch the latest commits

```shell
git fetch origin
```

- Reset Local copy to match that of the origin

```shell
git reset --hard origin/master
```

- Create and Checkout a new feature branch

```shell
git checkout -b new-feature
```

- Make Changes and Commit those changes

```shell
git status
git add <some-file>
git commit
```

- Push the new feature branch to origin and set the remote after which we can use just `git push`

```shell
git push -u origin new-feature
```

- Delete Local Branches Safely

```shell
git branch -d localBranchName
```

- Sync with the remote branches by pruning deleted remote branches

```shell
git fetch -p
```
